Flowers bloom in the springtime
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
A bird chirps a sweet melody in the morning
The ocean waves crash against the shore
The wind blows through the trees, rustling the leaves
The stars twinkle in the night sky
A rainbow appears after a rainstorm
Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles during a storm
Snowflakes fall silently to the ground
The moon glows in the dark of night
A baby's cry fills the room
A dog barks at the sound of a doorbell
A cat purrs contentedly when petted
A lion roars in the jungle
A butterfly flutters its wings and takes flight
A spider spins a delicate web to catch its prey
A snake slithers silently through the grass
A fish swims gracefully in the water
An ant crawls across the ground in search of food
A bee buzzes from flower to flower
A tree stands tall and strong in the forest
A mountain rises high into the sky
A river flows steadily
