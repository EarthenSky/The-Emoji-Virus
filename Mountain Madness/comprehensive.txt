Patty cake patty cake bakers man
The Dog sat in a chair
The pizza at the mountain madness hackathon was great
I wrote a letter to my love
Boom boom boom boom
She was de prettiest gal to be found
When the old man died
Well see him next year
When you wake up in the morning at a quarter to four
laugh and play laugh and play
Was the bottom of the deep blue chop chop chop
Her lips was red n her eyes was bright
No more monkeys jumping on the bed
It made the children laugh and play
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
The mouse ran up the clock
Mamas going to buy you a diamond ring
She couldnt write write write
If that diamond ring turns brass
July cant talk talk talk
And said What a good boy am I Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
They jumped so high high high
Up above the world so high
Quick as a cat can wink an eye
A snake slithers silently through the grass
The moon glows in the dark of night
A bird chirps a sweet melody in the morning
A fish swims gracefully in the water
The stars twinkle in the night sky
A bee buzzes from flower to flower
The ocean waves crash against the shore
The ocean waves crash against the shore
An ant crawls across the ground in search of food
