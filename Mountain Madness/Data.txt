But, she said, the butter is bitter
If I put it in my batter
It will make my batter bitter
But a bit of better butter
Would make my batter better.

Better than her bitter butter
And she put it in her batter
And the batter was not bitter 
So, that was better Betty Botter
Bought a bit of better butter.Oh, where have you been,

Good Morning To You, 
Good Morning To You, 
Good Morning, dear children, 
Good Morning To All!Goosey goosey gander, 
        Whither shall I wander? 
        Upstairs and downstairs, 
        And in my lady's chamber. 
        There I met an old man,
Who wouldn't say his prayers, 
So I took him by his left leg,
And threw him down the stairs.My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
        So it stood ninety years on the floor.
        It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
        Though it weighed not a pennyweight more. 
        It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, 
        And was always his treasure and pride. 
        But it stopped short, Never to go again, 
        When the old man died. 

<strong>Chorus:</strong> 
        Ninety years without slumbering, 
        Tick, tock, tick, tock. 
        His life seconds numbering, 
        Tick, tock, tick. 
        It stopped short, never to go again, 
        When the old man died. 

        In watching its pendulum Swing to and fro,
Many hours had he spent as a boy; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know,
And to share both his grief and his joy. 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door, 
With a blooming and beautiful bride. 
But it stopped short, never to go again, 
When the old man died. 

(Chorus) 

My grandfather said that of those he could hire, 
Not a servant so faithful he found. 
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire, 
At the close of each week to be wound. 
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face, 
And its hand never hung by its side. 
But it stopped short, never to go again, 
When the old man died. 

(Chorus) 

It rang an alarm In the dead of the night, 
An alarm that for years had been dumb. 
And we knew that his spirit was pluming its flight, 
That his hour of departure had come. 
Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime, 
As we silently stood by his side. 
But it stopped short, never to go again, 
When the old man died. 

(Chorus)Wash hands well each day,
      To keep germs away.
      Scrub with soap and water,
      And be on your way.

To keep germs away.

        Were four-and-twenty white mice, 
        With chains about their necks. 

        The captain was a duck, 
        With a packet on his back, 
        And when the ship began to move, 
        The captain said, "Quack! Quack!"

He pricked his fingers very much, 
Which made poor Simon whistle.Sing a song of sixpence
- A pocket full of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds
- Baked in a pie.

When the pie was opened,
The birds began to sing.
Wasn't that a dainty dish
To set before the king?

The king was in his counting house,
Counting out his money.
The queen was in the parlour,
Eating bread and honey.

The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes.
When down came a blackbird
And pecked off her nose!NoneSleep, baby, sleep

        Down where the woodbines creep; 
        Be always like the lamb so mild 
        A kind, and sweet, and gentle child.

        Had the fever and had it bad. 
        Just to root for the home town crew, 
        Ev'ry sou, 
        Katie blew. 
        On a Saturday her young beau, 
        Called to see if she'd like to go, 
        To see a show, but Miss Kate said; 
        No, I'll tell you what you can do: 

<strong>Take me out to the ball game, 
        Take me out with the crowd. 
        Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, 
        I don't care if I never get back. 
        Let me root, root, root for the home team, 
        If they don't win, it's a shame. 
        For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, 
        At the old ball game. </strong>

        Katie Casey saw all the games, 
        Knew the players by their first names. 
        Told the umpire he was wrong, 
        All along, 
        Good and strong. 
        When the score was just two to two, 
        Katie Casey knew what to do, 
        Just to cheer up the boys she knew, 
        She made the gang sing this song:

<strong> Take me out to the ball game, 
Take me out with the crowd. 
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, 
I don't care if I never get back. 
Let me root, root, root for the home team,

Singing with both boys and girls? Why not sing "boys/boy" and "girls/girl" every second time?

Toyland, toyland, 
        Wonderful girl and boy land. 
        While you dwell within it, 
        You are ever happy there.

        Childhood's joy land, 
        Mystic merry toyland. 
        Once you pass its borders, 
        You can never return again. 

        When you've grown up, my dears, 
        And are as old as I, 
        You'll laugh and ponder on the years, 
        That roll so swiftly by, my dears, 
        That roll so swiftly by. 

        Childhood's joy land, 
        Mystic merry toyland. 
        Once you pass its borders, 
        You can never return again.Tweedledum and Tweedledee 
        Agreed to have a battle. 
        For Tweedledum said Tweedledee 
        Had spoiled his nice new rattle. 
        Just then flew down a monstrous crow, 
        As black as a tar-barrel, 
        Which frightened both the heroes so,
        They quite forgot their quarrel!Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon.
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

Then the traveller in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark.
He could not see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so.

Two little dickie birds 
          Sitting on a wall,
          One named Peter, 
          One named Paul.
          Fly away Peter! 
          Fly away Paul!
          Come back Peter! 
			Come back Paul! Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town, 
        Up stairs and down stairs in his night-gown.
        Tapping at the window, crying at the lock, 
        Are the children in their bed, for it's past ten o'clock? 

        Hey, Willie Winkie, are you coming in? 
        The cat is singing purring sounds to the sleeping hen, 
        The dog's spread out on the floor, and doesn't give a cheep. 
        But here's a wakeful little boy who will not fall asleep! 

        Anything but sleep, you rogue! glowering like the moon, 
        Rattling in an iron jug with an iron spoon.
        Rumbling, tumbling round about, crowing like a cock, 
        Shrieking like I don't know what, waking sleeping folk. 

        Hey, Willie Winkie – the child's in a creel! 
        Wriggling from everyone's knee like an eel.
        Tugging at the cat's ear, and confusing all her thrums. 
        Hey, Willie Winkie! See, there he comes! 

        Weary is the mother who has a dusty child, 
        A small short little child, who can't run on his own.
        Who always has a battle with sleep before he'll close an eye, 
        But a kiss from his rosy lips gives strength anew to me. NoneWind the bobbin up,
      Wind the bobbin up,
      Pull, Pull, Clap, Clap, Clap,
      Point to the ceiling
      Point to the floor
      Point to the window
      Point to the door
      Clap your hands together - 1, 2, 3,
      Put your hands down on your knees.
       Yankee Doodle went to town 
        A-ridin' on a pony. 
        Stuck a feather in his cap, 
        And called it Macaroni. 
        Yankee Doodle, keep it up 
        Yankee Doodle dandy. 
        Mind the music and the step, 
      And with the girls be handy.
